Vasko the cat was sitting on the floor near the chest of drawers catching flies. And on the chest of drawers, on the very edge, lay a hat.

And then Vasko noticed that one fly sat on the hat. He almost jumped up and clawed at the hat. The hat slipped off the chest of drawers, Vasko broke off and flew to the floor!

And Volodya and Vadyk were sitting in the room. They painted pictures and did not see how Vasko got under the hat. They just heard something crash behind them and fall to the floor.

Volodya turned and noticed a hat on the floor near the chest of drawers. He came up, bent down, wanted to pick up his hat, and suddenly screamed:

- Ay-ay-ay! - and rushed to the side.

- What's wrong? - asks Vadyk.

- He is alive!

- Who is alive?

- Ka-ka-pe-diaper.

- What are you! Are hats alive?

- Look for yourself.

Vadyk came closer and began to examine the hat. Suddenly the hat crawled right at him. He will scream:

- Oh! - and jump on the couch.

Volodya is behind him.

The hat crawled into the middle of the room and stopped. The boys look at him and tremble with fear. Here the hat turned and crawled to the sofa.

- Oh! Oh! - screamed the boys.

They jumped off the couch and ran out of the room.

They ran to the kitchen and closed the door behind them.

- I p-pee-doo! - says Volodya.

- Where?

- I will go to my home.

- Why?

- I'm afraid of a hat. It's the first time I've seen a hat walk around the room.

- Or maybe someone is pulling him by the rope?

- Well, go and see.

- Let's go together. I'll take the poker. If he climbs up to us, I will hit him with a poker.

- Wait, I'll take the poker too.

- But we don't have a second poker.

- Well, I'll take a ski pole.

They took a poker and a ski pole, opened the door and looked into the room.

- Where is he? - asks Vadyk.

- He is there, by the table.

- Now I'm cracking him with a poker! - says Vadyk. - Let him come closer.

But the hat lay by the table and did not move.

- Yes, I was scared! - the boys rejoiced. - He is afraid to come near us.

- Now I will scare him, - said Vadyk.

He began to tap the floor with a poker and shouted:

- Hey you, hat!

But the hat didn't even move.

- Let's collect potatoes and throw them at him, - suggested Volodya.

They went to the kitchen, took potatoes from the basket and began to stuff them in their hats. They chattered, chatted, and finally Vadyk hit.

The hat will jump up!

- Meow! - shouted something.

They look, a gray tail appeared from under the hat, then a paw, and then the cat itself jumped out.

- Vasko! - the boys rejoiced.

- Apparently, he was sitting on the floor, and the hat fell on him from the chest of drawers, - Volodya guessed.

Vadyk grabbed Vask and let's hug him:

- Vasko, dear, how did you get under the hat?

But Vasko did not answer. He only snorted and squinted from the sunlight.
